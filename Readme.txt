This is an OpenGL project done with C language for Graphics and visualization take home assignment.

This rendering output able to do following animations:


The horse has to move from right to left in a forward direction in your rendered output
once you click on the keyboard character “F”.

• At the same time, when the horse moves forward when you press the character “R”,
it has to rotate the horse’s tail clockwise.

• Later, a horse has to rotate 180 degrees clockwise and move from left to right in your
rendered output once we click on the keyboard character “Q”.

• A boat has to move from left to right in a forward direction when you press the
keyboard character “B”.

• At the same time, when the boat moves, its bat has to move backward when you press
on the keyboard “W” character.

• Once you press the character “U” it has to scale up the size of all the flower pots that
are located on the left side and scale up all the fishes that are located on the right side
by considering half of the previous scaling factor.

• Once we press the character “S” it has to scale down the size of all the plants that are
located on the right side.

• When we pressed the “space bar” it had to move the sun (from right to left) and scale
down the bigger flower pot, which is on the right side.
